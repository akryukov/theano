            Theano is a common name for some fonts I have designed from historic
            samples. Most of these fonts were initially intended as Greek-only
            faces, but finally I found it interesting to supplement them with
            stylistically compatible Latin letters, thus reproducing the general
            look of old classical text editions. For this reason Theano fonts currently
            have no additional weights or styles and don't provide extensive Unicode
            coverage: just a standard set of Latin and Greek characters (including
            the full polytonic set) and some additional characters I found interesting
            to design. Nevertheless I decided to make them publicly available in the
            hope they can be useful for other classicists or medievalists.

            The package is named after Theano, a famous Ancient Greek woman
            philosopher, who was first a student of Pythagoras, and supposedly became
            his wife. In 1211 or 1212 Michael Choniates, a highly educated Greek
            Metropolitan of Athens, wrote a large poem devoted to Theano (the προοίμιον
            of that poem is used as an epigraph for this document). Thus Theano seemed a
            good example of a person joining the ancient and the medieval world.
            Another reason for which I selected her name is that it starts from
            theta, just like Thessalonica (Θεσσαλονίκη in Greek)~--- the name of my
            keyboard input and conversion utility for Ancient Greek.

            Theano Old Style is a modernized ``Old Style'' Greek font with a large
            number of historical ligatures and alternate forms, modelled after some early
            19th century types designed by Figgins' type foundry. It is accompanied by
            a Latin face based on some ``Old Style'' Roman fonts of the late 19th and
            early 20th century.

            PREAMBLE
            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
