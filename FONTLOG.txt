Theano Classical Fonts
======================

This file provides detailed information on Theano Classical Fonts.
This information should be distributed along with tTheano Classical Fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Theano is a common name for some fonts I have designed from historic
samples. Most of these fonts were initially intended as Greek-only
faces, but finally I found it interesting to supplement them with
stylistically compatible Latin letters, thus reproducing the general
look of old classical text editions. For this reason Theano fonts currently
have no additional weights or styles and don't provide extensive Unicode
coverage: just a standard set of Latin and Greek characters (including
the full polytonic set) and some additional characters I found interesting
to design. Nevertheless I decided to make them publicly available in the
hope they can be useful for other classicists or medievalists.

The package is named after Theano, a famous Ancient Greek woman
philosopher, who was first a student of Pythagoras, and supposedly became
his wife. In 1211 or 1212 Michael Choniates, a highly educated Greek
Metropolitan of Athens, wrote a large poem devoted to Theano. Thus Theano
seemed a good example of a person joining the ancient and the medieval world.
Another reason for which I selected her name is that it starts from
theta, just like Thessalonica -- the name of my keyboard input and conversion 
utility for Ancient Greek.

ChangeLog
---------

2011 April 18 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 2.0

    * Implemented a basic set of Cyrillic letters (those in windows-1251 and
      those needed for Russian and Bulgarian pre-reform orthography).

    * Added editorial signs and New Testament critical signs.

    * I no longer use custom PUA mappings. I have preserved PUA codepoints for
      a few standard glyphs (including capital accents) previously mapped there
      by Adobe, as well as for additional accented Greek characters implemented
      for compatibility with Ralph Hancock's fonts. Everything else has been moved
      outside the encoding.

    * Implemented a full set of subscript/superscript digits and denominators.

    * New implementation for the 'frac' feature: it is now possible to build
      any arbitrary fractions rather than just those available in Unicode in the
      precomposed form.

    * SIL's Graphite rendering technologie is now supported. The features available
      are mostly the same as for OpenType, but there are some additions (in
      particular it is possible to render a Greek text with accents above capitals).
      The manual has also been changed to reflect the new functionality.

    * Added human-readable stylistic set names (US English only).

2008 November 23 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0.1

    * Wrong font names were specified in the `Preferred family' field.

    * If the same set of rules is shared by several features, then
      use just one lookup registered for more than one feature to store them.

2008 November 18 (Alexey Kryukov) Version 1.0

    * First public release.
